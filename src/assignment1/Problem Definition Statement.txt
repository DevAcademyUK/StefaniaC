Problem Definition Statement


The user needs to: 
* log into their account

* deposit into their account
* withdraw from their account
* navigate between different accounts (current account, joint account, savings account)
* transfer funds from one account to another
* log out from their account
XBank has a problem with the service they provide to their users. The users can only request the bank teller to check the balance of their accounts, transfer, deposit or withdraw funds. 
The solution proposed for this issue was to create a Java application which will allow the user to access their accounts and transfer funds, make deposits and withdraws from the computer terminals in the bank’s branch.
This will allow bank tellers more time to solve more complex user issues and will make the banking experience faster and more secure.
